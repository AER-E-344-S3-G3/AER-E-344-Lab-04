\section{Coefficient of Pressure Distribution} \label{sec c_p_distribution}

\autoref{fig:c_p_distribution} shows the coefficient of pressure, \gls{C_P}, around the cylinder at motor frequencies of \qtyrange{5}{35}{\hertz}. The \gls{C_P} for each motor frequency was calculated at \qty{20}{\degree} increments around the cylinder using \autoref{eq:pressurecoeff_2} from data measured with the Scanivalve DSA 3217 and collected using the data acquisition software (see \autoref{sec:procedures}). The theoretical solution was calculated using the equation:

\begin{equation}\label{eq:theoretical_sol}
    C_P = 1 - 4\sin^2{\theta}
\end{equation}

To demonstrate the uniformity of the flow at higher velocities, \autoref{fig:c_p_distribution_exc} excludes the pressure distribution curves for the \qtyrange{5}{15}{\hertz} motor frequencies.

\section{Coefficient of Drag} \label{sec c_d}

\autoref{fig:c_d_cylinder_re} shows the relationship between \gls{C_d} and the Reynolds number. \autoref{eq:Re} is used to calculate Reynolds number at the different fluid velocities.
