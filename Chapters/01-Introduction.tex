The Scanivalve DSA 3217, a \num{16}-channel digital pressure transducer, calculates the differences in pressure between the input ports and the calibrated reference pressure. In this experiment, the ports of the pressure transducer are connected to pressure taps that wrap radially around a cylinder (see \autoref{fig: Circular Cylinder Airfoil in the Wind Tunnel}). The Scanivalve pressure transducer is also measuring the pressure at the inlet and outlet of the contraction section.

Using the Scanivalve pressure transducers in conjunction with the data acquisition software, we will measure the pressure at \qty{20}{\degree} increments around the cylinder to quantitatively determine the flow characteristics and compare the results to the theoretical flow solution.
