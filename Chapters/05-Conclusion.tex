Using the Scanivalve DSA 3217 pressure transducers, we measured the pressure from \num{18} ports around a cylinder at a range of velocities. We used the data acquired by the Scanivalve pressure transducers to calculate the \gls{C_P} distribution around the cylinder. Once the \gls{C_P} distribution was evaluated, we then determined the coefficient of drag, \gls{C_d}, and plotted it against the Reynolds number. In the range of \qtyrange{150}{225}{\degree}, our experimental data tracked the theoretical pressure distribution well. The data collected when the motor frequency was between \qtylist{5;15}{\hertz} had several significant outliers and generally did not act as uniform compared to the higher velocity flowsâ€”likely due to turbulence or viscous effects.
